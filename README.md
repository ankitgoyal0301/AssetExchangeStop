# Asset Exchange Stop

## Prerequisites :-
- Node.js should be installed.
- ***“npm i -g truffle”*** command must have been run previously.

## INSTRUCTIONS : -
- Download the git repository.
- Delete the ***"package-lock.json"*** file.
- Open cmd/windows powershell in same directory and run ***“npm install”***.
- In case of any ERROR, try again and again deleting the partially created ***"node_modules"*** folder and ***"package-lock.json"***.( in case they are created)
- If error persists, try changing proxy settings of your computer (this hack may work).
- When everything is successfully installed, run ***“npm run start”*** in the same directory.
(Hopefully site will launch)

## WORKING :-
### Lets understand by an example:
- Suppose User A wants to send ether from his wallet on Kovan to his wallet on Ropsten and User B wants to send ether from his wallet on Ropsten to his wallet on Kovan.
- As they cannot do this, so they will help each other.
- So A will send to B’s account on Kovan and B will send to A’s account on Ropsten.
- The website will detect the account and network from Metamask.
- Metamask automatically detects network change and site reloads but if you only change account selected then it is mandatory to refresh the page or else all transactions will fail.

### SENDING PROCESS :
- 4 smart contracts are already deployed on 4 blockchains and website connects to them automatically.
- The Users decide the amount of ether to send , exchange wallet addresses, agree on a consensus key and exchange e-mails.(This has to be done offline).
- A will now send 0.1 Eth(suppose) from his/her Account 1 on Kovan to smart contract of Kovan. (He/she will select Kovan network on Metamask and then the account from which to send).
- Similarly B will send 0.1 Eth from Account 1’ on Ropsten to Ropsten smart contract.
- All fields must be properly filled as directed on the webpage.
- Proper checks are there to check whether entered information is correct.
- Once the sending is successful, users will be assigned a transaction id.
- Remember it, next a mail sending pop up will open (if pop ups are not disabled) and user has to enter the details asked by it.
- Now both users can check the status of the transaction done by both of them (sender and receiver accounts both are allowed to check).
- Transaction Verification has to be done in 15 minutes.
- After 15 minutes, only refund can be claimed by the sending user (obviously from the account and network from which he/ she had sent the funds).

### VERIFICATION PROCESS :
- Any user can verify both transactions.
- A can verify only by changing network to other blockchain (in this case Ropsten ) and through the account A had told B to send funds for.
- Same case is with B , can verify only on Kovan blockchain and using same account he had told A to send funds on.
- Lets suppose A will verify.
- A will change Metamask network to Ropsten and select account 2.
- He/she will fill the said details correctly.
- Then The transaction will be successfully verified and both will receive money.

OTHER PROCESSES ARE QUITE CLEAR.
