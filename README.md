Prerequisites :-
1. Node.js should be installed.
2. “npm i -g truffle” command must have been run previously.

INSTRUCTIONS : -
1. Download the git repository.
2. Delete the package-lock.json file.
3. Open cmd/windows powershell in same directory and run “npm install”.
4. IN CASE SOME ERROR OCCURS…TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN AFTER DELETING THE PARTIALLY CREATED “NODE_MODULES” FOLDER AND “PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON” ( in case they are created).
5. If error persists, try changing proxy settings of your computer (this hack may work).
6. When everything is successfully installed, run “npm run start” in the same directory
(Hopefully site will launch).
